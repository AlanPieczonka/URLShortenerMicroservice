## URL Shortener Microservice in Golang

I've always wanted to learn Go basics, so I decided to do a small project

**User:**

* can pass a URL as a parameter and he will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response
* can visit shortened URL and it will redirect him to the original link

### Installation & Running:
	git clone https://github.com/AlanPieczonka/URLShortenerMicroservice.git
	cd URLShortenerMicroservice
	go run main.go
	visit localhost:8000
